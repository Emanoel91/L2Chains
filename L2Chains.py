After the crash of the **Terra network**, its users and developers made various proposals to restore it. Finally, it was decided that a new network will be launched and 
its cryptocurrencies will be divided among the users of the previous network with a certain ratio. The new network, which started its work on **May 28, 2022**, is called 
**Terra** and its native cryptocurrency is **LUNA**. 
The new **Terra network** is based on the **Cosmos SDK**. The difference between the new network and the previous network is that there is no native **stablecoin** in this 
network and the **Burn/Mint** mechanism has also been removed from it. One of the remarkable points of the new network is that only **10%** of its cryptocurrencies belong to 
its development team and **90%** of the cryptocurrencies are owned by users. Considering this issue, it can be said that the **Terra network** is one of the few blockchain 
networks whose ownership is almost completely in the hands of its user community.

We created a dashboard documenting significant trends in **transactions**, **wallets**, **supply**, **staking**, **development**, or other aspects of the **Terra ecosystem.**
In page '**ðŸ“±Addresses**', the number of active addresses and new wallets in 2023 is shown. In page '**ðŸ› Development**', users can see the number of new contracts in 2023. 
In page '**ðŸ’§LP Actions**', all actions, whether providing or withdrawing liquidity in the new year, are monitored. NFTs are considered one of the most attractive ideas 
in the blockchain world. In page '**ðŸ“¸NFTs**', all activities related to minting and buying and selling NFTs using LUNA currency can be seen. All information about the price and 
supply of LUNA can be accessed in page '**ðŸ’µPrice & Supply**'. Staking is when users lock crypto assets for a set period of time to help support the operation of a blockchain. 
All information related to staking of LUNA currency is collected in page '**ðŸ©¸Staking**'. The data related to the LUNA swap is shown in 
page '**ðŸ”„Swap**'. Refer to page '**ðŸ’¸Transfers**' to view the status of LUNA transfers between different addresses. In page '**ðŸ’³Transactions**', the number of transactions and the amount of fees paid are shown.
